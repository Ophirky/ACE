RTP (Real-time Transfer Protocol) - Summary:

RTP protocol is used over a UDP connection.

RTP Packet:
	- Payload type identification: kind of data sent (video or audio and more)
	- Source Identifier: identify source
	- Sequence numbering: used for loss detection
	- Time stamping: used for timing recovery
	- Marker: used for significant events in data stream (defined by the application)

Header Format:
| v=2 | P | X | CC | M | PT | SEQUENCE NUMBER | 4 bytes
|                 TIME STAMP                  | 4 bytes
|       Synchronization Source ID - SSRC      | 4 bytes
|       Contributing Source Ids (CSRCs)       | 4 bytes
|              EXTENSION HEADER               | Optional
|         RTP PYALOAD HDR + PAYLOAD           |

v (2 bit) - version identifier
p (1 bit) - padding bit (when RTP payload needs to be padded
x (1 bit) - Extension bit, set when an extension header is added
CC (4 bit) - count of contributing sources (CSRC COunt)
M (1 bit) - Marker Bit, used for frame indication
PT (7 bits) - Payload types, every payload type has a specific number (a table can be found on wikipedia)
Sequuence Number (16 bit) - To detect missing and misordered packets

TIME STAMP (4 bytes) - To enable different media streams to be synchronized (like number of ticks)
SSRC - Uniquely identifies single source of RTP stream
CSRCs - When number of RTP streams pass through a mixer (Mixer becomes SSRC)

RTP Mixer:
	Multiple sources to one receiver.
	When a mixer is used the Mixer will become the SSRC and the original sources will become the CSRCs
	
Validating RTP Packets:
	There is no protocol field like in HTTP so you can search for the version header.
